<h1> Singleton</h1>

<ul>
  <li>A SIngleton class has only one instance, accessible globally through a single point (via a method / field)</li>
  <li> Main problem this pattern solves is too ensure that only a single instance of this class exists.
  <li> any state you add in your singleton becanme part of "global state" ofyyour application.
</ul>

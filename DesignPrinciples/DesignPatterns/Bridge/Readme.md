<h1>Bridge</h1>
- Our implementation & abstraction are generally coupled o each other in normal inheritance.
- Using bridge pattern we can decouple them so they can bothe change withoout affecting each other.
- we achieve this feat by changing two seperate inheritance hierarchies; one for implementation and other for abstractions
- we use composition to bridge these two hierarchies.

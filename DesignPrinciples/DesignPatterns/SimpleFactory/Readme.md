<h2>Simple Factory</h2>

- In this we simply move the instantiation logic to the seperate class and most commanly to a seperate static method of tthis class.
- We dont consider simple factory as design  pattern as it is just an encapsulation of object instantiation.
- Typically we do this if we have more than one option when instantiation object and simple logic is used to choose the correct class.
